# UAV-image-mosaicing-dataset
Dataset for Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) Image Mosaicking
The datasetÂ  consists of hundreds of images captured by the UAV, and the corresponding DOMs generated by DPGrid. 
The DOMs can be used as the golden standard to evaluate your mosaicking algorithms. 
If you use the datasets in your work, please cite our paper:
